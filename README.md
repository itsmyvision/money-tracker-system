# money-tracker-system
Developed a Java-based system which allows the user to view daily/monthly review of money spent and can analyze his/her expense.

To sum it up, this is just a simple platform offering user to log-in/sign-up, add expense, add deposit, view/update their profile and analyze daily/monthly review of money spent.
Hope you will find it interesting and useful.
